  <h2><strong> Biography</strong></h2>
  <p> I am a third year student at California State University of Northridge. I am majoring in System Operations Managment. I enjoy to play video games and hang out with my friends on my free time. I also have two jobs apart from being a full time student. I hope to graduate from CSUN and find a job out of state.<p>

  	<h4><strong>Work Experience</strong></h4>
  	<p>I currently take 15 units and go to school two days out of the week. The other five days of the week I am working. I work at an accounting firm on the weekdays and I work my family's business on the weekends. My family owns a donut shop in mission hills and I have been working there ever since i was a little kid. After working there so long I decided to get another job purely for experience. How I manange working 40 hours a week at two jobs and take five classes at the same time is beyond me.</p>
